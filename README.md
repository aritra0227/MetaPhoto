# MetaPhoto

## Description:
Metaphoto is a fun collage application that operates by taking a primary image and a collection of candidate images as inputs. Its purpose is to arrange the candidate images in an optimal manner, using a specified loss function as a guiding factor, in order to replicate the appearance of the primary image. This process results in a visually appealing composition where the candidate images collectively emulate the main image.

### Note:
* Currently utilizing the torch dataset "Places365" to pick a required number of random images for the candidate photos
